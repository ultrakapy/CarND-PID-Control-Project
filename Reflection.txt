Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation:

The P component determines how hard / quickly to steer toward the center of the road.
The D component prevents the car from overshooting the center of the road too much due to the P component, so it
gradually approaches the center and doesn't overshoot too much. This component tries to minimize how much the car
oscillates around the center of the road.
Finally, the I component accounts for any systematic bias that causes a consistently large CTE.


Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen:

I thought about implementing the Twiddle algorithm, but since there is currently no way to run the simulator in headless
mode I decided to tune the parameters manually. I started by setting the P parameter to -1.0 and the other parameters to
0.0 then running and tuning the P parameter for a few laps. I repeated the process for the I and D parameters.
